## Basic Workflow

### 1. Open Your Project

- Click "Open Folder" and select your project directory
- Rufas will scan and monitor your files automatically
- The file tree will appear on the left

### 2. Set Up Tags

1. Click "New Tag" in the Tags panel
2. Create some basic tags for your project, for example:
   - `docs` - Documentation files
   - `core` - Core functionality
   - `config` - Configuration files
3. Each tag can have:
   - Name
   - Description
   - Color for visual identification

### 3. Tag Your Files

1. Select files in the file tree (use Ctrl/Cmd for multiple)
2. Click "Tag Files" to assign tags
3. Tags appear as colored dots next to files

### 4. Create a Bundle

1. Select the files you want to share with AI
2. Click "New Bundle"
3. Give your bundle:
   - Name (e.g., "Auth System Overview")
   - Description
4. The bundle will track these files

### 5. Export for AI

1. Find your bundle in the Bundles panel
2. Click the export icon
3. Rufas creates an XML file optimized for AI consumption

## Tips for Success

### Effective Tagging

- Use consistent tag names
- Don't over-tag - focus on key categories
- Use colors effectively for visual scanning

### Smart Bundling

- Create focused, purpose-specific bundles
- Update bundles before AI sessions
- Watch for the "changes since export" indicator

### Monitoring Changes

- Check the heartbeat indicator for file monitoring
- Review "changes since last export" before AI sessions
- Update stale bundles as needed

## Common Tasks

### Filtering Files

1. Click the filter icon in the file tree
2. Select tags to filter by
3. Tree updates to show only matching files

### Updating Bundles

1. Open the bundle editor
2. Add/remove files as needed
3. Export again when ready

### Managing Tags

1. Edit - Click the edit icon on any tag
2. Delete - Click the X icon (removes tag, not files)
3. Reassign - Click tag dots to remove from specific files
