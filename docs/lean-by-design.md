# Working With Your Existing Process

## Lean by Design

Rufas recognizes that you likely already have systems in place for project organization:

- GitHub issues for tracking problems
- Project boards for feature planning
- Documentation in your preferred format
- Established folder structures
- Existing tagging conventions

The last thing you need is another heavy-handed project management tool demanding you change how you work.

## Rufas's Approach

Instead of replacing your existing systems, Rufas:

- Watches and learns from your existing file structure
- Adds a lightweight layer of context through tags
- Builds on the organization you already have
- Prepares your existing content for AI consumption

When you need to share project context with AI:

- Your existing documentation is already there
- Your natural file organization is preserved
- Your usual workflow remains unchanged
- Rufas just helps package it appropriately

## Minimum Overhead

Rufas aims to:

- Require minimal additional effort
- Work alongside your existing tools
- Add value without adding complexity
- Turn your natural organization into AI-ready formats

Remember: If you're already organizing your project (and you probably are), you're already doing most of what Rufas needs. We just help transform that organization into something AI can better understand.
