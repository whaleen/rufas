# When to Use Rufas

## The AI Interaction Workflow

While some tools offer direct repository connections or document uploads, Rufas takes a more strategic approach to sharing project context with AI. Here's when Rufas is most valuable:

### Preparing for AI Sessions

When you're about to:

- Write prompts for code review
- Discuss new feature implementation
- Debug complex issues
- Generate code for new functionality
- Get architectural advice

This is when you open Rufas to:

1. Review your project's current state
2. Update relevant bundles
3. Check for context drift
4. Prepare focused context for your AI session

### Strategic Context Bundling

Rather than dumping entire repositories or random documents into AI chats, Rufas helps you:

- Select relevant context strategically
- Create purpose-specific bundles
- Track what context you've shared
- Manage context freshness

### Controlled Knowledge Sharing

While other tools might offer:

```
✗ Direct repo connections
✗ Bulk document uploads
✗ Automated context sharing
```

Rufas provides:

```
✓ Controlled context selection
✓ Strategic bundle creation
✓ Context freshness tracking
✓ Change awareness
```

## Practical Usage Flow

1. **Before AI Chat**

   - Open Rufas alongside your AI tool
   - Review project state
   - Update or create relevant bundles
   - Check for stale context

2. **During AI Chat**

   - Share specific bundles as needed
   - Keep track of shared context
   - Update bundles if discussion scope changes

3. **After AI Chat**
   - Note which bundles were effective
   - Update bundles based on discussion
   - Track changes for future sessions

## Remember

Rufas isn't a passive project-AI connector - it's an active tool for preparing and managing your AI interactions. Use it when you're in "prompt writing mode" to make your AI sessions more focused and effective.
