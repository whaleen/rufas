we should have a way to select a span of files in the tree

we should examine how the tree behaves when we select a span of files

when we select a folder it collapses or expands, which it should, however we are using the same selection pattern for selecting files, which is not ideal as the system thinks we have selected an object that should be treated like a file.

Bla bla bla
