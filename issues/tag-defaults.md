i like the tags names i am using at the moment, but i am not sure if they are the best ones.

i want to narrow down to a short list of default tags that are meaningful and useful for most users.

this will be a process of discovery and iteration, but i think it is worth starting with a list of tags that are common in most projects so let's base that off of what we are presently using.

these are good deafults for now:

config

The stuff that nightmares are made of.

docs

What is Rufas and why is Rufas

features

For main feature implementations. Components that implement major user-facing functionality

components-ui

For reusable UI components and interface elements. Basic building blocks like button.tsx, dialog.tsx, input.tsx.

core

For critical system files that handle the fundamental operations. Files that implement the core concepts and handle state management

types

For type definitions and interfaces. Files that primarily define types and interfaces used across the project.

issues

Stuff to work on.

style

Tailwind. We also use shadcn/ui as a primary component library and that uses Tailwind as well.
