priority: 'of utmost importance'

in the bundle card we are tracking some metrics like:

- number of files
- last export date
- Changes since last export (new files, removed files...

we are not yet tracking modified files so we should explore how to do that

help me define this issue more completely as we examine the codwe base together and find a solution

update:

files have been modified (since last export) seems to be working now. we should continue to test this and make sure it is working as expected
